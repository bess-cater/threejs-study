Three js study project using models I created from scratch in Blender.

To run this project I used parcel (installed globally):
```
npm install -g parcel@latest
parcel ./src/index.html

```
Please note that the app will run on port 4008 (USE SET PORT=YOUR PORT to specify another port).

Now there is only a sad-looking cat you can rotate by dragging.

You can also press its tummy andleft paw and see what will hapen :)
